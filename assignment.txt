I have attached the links of the github repository and the live streamlit app.

About the Project :-
I have used a Medical QA Dataset which includes columns like
1. Pub ID
2. Question
3. Context
4. Long Answer
5. Final Decision

About the Project files :-
The RAG.ipynb file contains the code for building the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline and training the model to answer questions based on the provided dataset.

And the rag.py file contains the code that generates the FAISS vector store from the data.

The app.py file loads the vector store, initializes the retriever and LLM, creates a QA chain using the retriever and LLM and launches a web interface using Streamlit to serve the application on localhost.
